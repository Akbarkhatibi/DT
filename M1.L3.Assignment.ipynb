But... some of them do not know their constellation.  \n\nIn this assignment you will have to implement new functions to complement horoscope( ) and retrieve, interactively, the daily fortune based on the date of birth.\n\n### 1.1 Create a skyfortune( ) function that:   \n\n- Prints greetings and the twelve zodiac signs options  \n- Asks the user to input the number of their sign or write **\"no idea\"** to calculate their sign. Use `input( )` built-in function and store the user value in a variable \n- Include an `if`-statement to call either `horoscope( )` function when the user knows the sign or a new function  called **\"constellation\"**  \n- Create the new function `constellation( )` to request the birth date of the user, calculate the zodiac sign accordingly and print the zodiac sign for the user. Then, call `horoscope( )`",
